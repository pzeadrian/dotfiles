My config files for Arch Linux...

The starting point of this guide is right after a complete clean Arch based
distro installation. The
**[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide)**
doesn't tell you what to do after setting the root password, so I suggest you to follow the steps below.

- First: [Post Installation](https://github.com/pzeadrian/dotfilesArch/tree/main/1_PostInstall)
- Second: [GUI](https://github.com/pzeadrian/dotfilesArch/tree/main/2_DesktopGUI) - ([DE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment) or even a [WM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/window_manager))
- Third: [Basic Settings](https://github.com/pzeadrian/dotfilesArch/tree/main/3_Basics) for a better daily use
